# python-validity
Validity fingerprint sensor library.
Originally designed to capture some of my findings for 138a:0097, but if you manage to get it working for some other Validity sensor - pull requests are welcome.



## Setting up the build environment

To set up the environment before running commands like `python3 factory-reset.py`, follow these steps:

* Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
* Create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv <env_name>`.
* Activate the virtual environment:
  * On Windows: `<env_name>\Scripts\activate`
  * On Unix or MacOS: `source <env_name>/bin/activate`
* Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -e .` in the root directory of the repository. This will read the `setup.py` file and install the required packages.
* Verify that the dependencies are installed correctly by running `pip list`.
* Install `gcc` as a prerequisite before running `pip install -e .`:
  * On Debian-based systems: `sudo apt-get install gcc`
  * On Red Hat-based systems: `sudo yum install gcc`

This will ensure that the dependencies are isolated within the virtual environment and do not interfere with the system-wide packages.

## Initialization

### Automatic factory reset, pairing and firmware flashing

This repo includes `validity-sensors-tools.py`, a simple collection of
tools that helps initializing Validity fingerprint readers under linux,
loading their binary firmware and initializing them.

This tool currently only supports these sensors:
- 138a:0090 Validity Sensors, Inc. VFS7500 Touch Fingerprint Sensor
- 138a:0097 Validity Sensors, Inc.
Which are present in various ThinkPad and HP laptops.

These devices communicate with the laptop via an encrypted protocol and they
need to be paired with the host computer in order to work and compute the
TLS keys.
Such initialization is normally done by the Windows driver, however thanks to
the amazing efforts of Viktor Dragomiretskyy (uunicorn), and previously of
Nikita Mikhailov, we have reverse-engineerd the pairing process, and so it's
possible to do it under Linux with only native tools as well.

The procedure is quite simple:
- Device is factory-reset and its flash repartitioned
- A TLS key is negotiated, generated via host hw ID and serial
- Windows driver is downloaded from Lenovo to extract the device firmware
- The device firmware is uploaded to the device
- The device is calibrated

For 138a:0097 it's also possible to enroll fingers in the internal storage
doing:
`validity-sensors-tools.py --tool enroll --finger-id [0-9]`

Once the chip is paired with the computer via this tool, it's possible to use
it in libfprint using the driver at
- https://github.com/3v1n0/libfprint/

#### Installing it as [snap](https://snapcraft.io/)

This tool can be easily installed [almost every linux distribution](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd)
with all its dependencies as snap.

To do so:

```bash
sudo snap install validity-sensors-tools

# Give it access to the usb devices
sudo snap connect validity-sensors-tools:raw-usb
sudo snap connect validity-sensors-tools:hardware-observe

# Initialize the device
sudo validity-sensors-tools.initializer

# Test the device
sudo validity-sensors-tools.led-test

# See other avilable tools
validity-sensors-tools --help
```

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/validity-sensors-tools)

#### Installing from AUR on Arch Linux

Install [validity-sensors-tools-git<sup>[AUR]</sup>](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/validity-sensors-tools-git/).

You can run it as `validity-sensors-tools`:

```bash
sudo validity-sensors-tools -t led-dance
```

### Getting the firmware

It's possible to just extract [official Lenovo device driver for vfs0097](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/DS121407) or [driver for vfs0090](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/DS120491) (also [part of the SCCM package](https://support.lenovo.com/ec/th/downloads/DS112113) using [innoextract](https://constexpr.org/innoextract/) (available for all the distros), or `wine`.

The only reason you need to do this is to find `6_07f_lenovo_mis.xpfwext` (for vfs0097) or `6_07f_Lenovo.xpfwext` (for vfs0090) and copy it to this project location.

      innoextract n1mgf03w.exe -e -I 6_07f_lenovo_mis.xpfwext # vfs0097
      innoextract n1cgn08w.exe -e -I 6_07f_Lenovo.xpfwext # vfs0090


## Setting up the script execution environment

Install packages
```
gcc
python-devel
gmp-devel
innoextract
```

Install Python dependencies
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Factory reset
If your device was previously paired with another OS or computer, you need to do a factory reset.
This will erase all fingers from the internal database and make the device ready for pairing.
```
$ python3 factory-reset.py
$
```

### Pairing
After performing a factory reset you need to pair your device with a host computer.
This must be done only once, before you can enroll/identify/verify fingers.
```
$ python3 pair.py

## Examples
Here is a couple of examples of how you can use this library. All examples assume that your device is already paired.

### Initialize a session
Before talking to a device you will need to open it and start a new TLS session
```
$ python3
Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17) 
[GCC 8.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from prototype import *
>>> open97()
>>>
```
Or load previosly saved TLS session (see comments in [holdthedoor.py](holdthedoor.py))
```
$ python3
Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17) 
[GCC 8.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from prototype import *
>>> load97()
>>> 
```

### Enroll a new user

### Identify a finger (scan)
```
>>> identify()

```
## DBus service
Sources contain a simple DBus service which can impersonate [fprint](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint/) daemon. 
Install fprint, edit /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/net.reactivated.Fprint.service by commenting out activation info:
```
#Exec=/usr/lib/fprintd/fprintd
#User=root
#SystemdService=fprintd.service
```
start a fake service with something like this:
```
while sleep 1; do
    python3 dbus-service.py
    echo "====restart==="
done
```


## Debugging
If you are curious you can enable tracing to see what flows in and out of device before and after encryption
```
>>> tls.trace_enabled=True
>>> usb.trace_enabled=True
>>> db.dump_all()
